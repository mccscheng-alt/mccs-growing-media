    sections: [
      ['1. Record the local operating context', 'Document city or project location, greenhouse type, crop, tray, cooling method, water source, nutrient program and trial dates. Conditions can differ substantially between projects, so a generic regional claim is not enough.'],
      ['2. Characterize water and irrigation inputs', 'Record source-water EC and pH using the project\'s normal method, irrigation volume and frequency, drainage observations and any water treatment. Keep these inputs linked to each treatment.'],
      ['3. Use Saudi-local samples for screening', 'For qualified Saudi projects, local sample access can shorten initial evaluation. Confirm sample availability, model and collection or delivery arrangement with sales before planning the trial. Local availability does not replace model confirmation or a documented protocol.'],
      ['4. Compare under the same greenhouse zone', 'Place control and candidate treatments in comparable positions and use the same crop and observation schedule. Record hydration, surface condition, plant uniformity, root-zone handling and transplant observations.'],
      ['5. Add import and supply review after technical fit', 'Once the local trial passes, review required volume, packaging, shipping route, documentation and replenishment timing. Separate the agronomic decision from the commercial logistics decision, then approve both before scale-up.']
